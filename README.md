### About me

  I am a self-taught Front-End Developer. Came almost naturally. I'd been always attracted by image, design and arts. I studied photography at the [IEFC](https://www.iefc.cat/es/). Design came after at [Groc](https://groc.cat/es/) school.
  After years at [Wagamama](https://www.wagamama.ie/?utm_source=maps&utm_medium=king-street-south&utm_campaign=gmb) and [Hard Rock](https://www.hardrockcafe.com/location/barcelona/es/) (where I've learnt many, many skills) I decided that it was time to achieve an old goal of mine: become a web designer... and programming got in the middle, and so pleased it did!
